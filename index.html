    <h4>New Life</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>NEW LIFE is a project about a utopian/dystopian world
         where a private company has created technology that 
         can bring virtual characters to life. Unfortunately, 
         a virus has infected their machines, causing them to malfunction. 
         The viruses cause the devices to create game characters that are 
         enormous and at times malevolent.</p>
    <p>Humanity is presently combating these beings, 
        and because the company was unprepared for the 
        consequences of its efforts, humans have had to employ 
        military equipment and technology. Frantic attempts are 
        being made to restrict the infection and kill the characters. 
        Research investigating the character's internal structure is 
        also being conducted in order to avoid future attacks and to 
        learn how to exploit the new technology. </p>

    <h6>Techinal</h6>
    <p>I used Blender to create 3d environments, 
        my goal is to use body parts of characters to 
        create the work and use mannequins to represent humans. 
        I model most of the elements, the rest I use the assets, 
        then aggregate them together. Then I moved on to the material, 
        which is my favorite part, lighting, and rendering. 
        Finally, I use the Photoshoot to add background and little effects.</p>

    </div>
    <p>To be successful in creating these ideas I think the most 
        important thing is to find a camera angle so that the perspective 
        makes humans look small compared to the characters. 
        There are some examples of the rendering I try to figure out 
        the camera angle to make people feel the human away smaller than 
        the objects.</p>

    <h6>Final Results</h6>
    <p>I decided to divide my project into 2 parts. 
        The first part is about the presence of the characters 
        in the surrounding life.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column2">
            <img src="images/1.png" style="width:100%">

        <div class="column2">
            <img src="images/2 final.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
            <img src="images/4 final.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The second part is about humans exploiting their potential. 
        they grafted parts of the human body into them turning them
         into whole new bodies. Breeding is also part of progress, 
         to form a new generation to be bigger and stronger.</p>

    <h6 id="about">About</h6>
    <p>My name is Minh (Mjin). I am a 3D artist, I am presently a student at RMIT University in Melbourne,
         and this website contains all the projects I completed while I was in school. These projects are 
         connected to the assignments I completed, and I want to approach each one carefully and creatively.
        The reason I do this is that I love creativity and especially working with 3D environments and creating 
        products because we can communicate ideas as well as meaning, stories through those 3D environments. 
        Welcome to my own world and hope you can see something interesting in my works. Thanks </p>
